b.	A web application uses a database to get Employee data. The application could use the database API directly,
but this would result in a number of low-level SQL calls scattered throughout the code (setting the connection,
building queries, extracting results, building Employee objects, etc.).

Explain how you can design the application so that it is not directly dependent on the database used, and so
getting and setting employee data wonâ€™t be such a pain.

We could use the simple factory method to create a the connection, then we could use an facade pattern to make the
low-level calls easier to work with by simplifying by abstracting it to a higher level interface.
